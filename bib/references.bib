To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. We also compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above $5) to the changes at lower-wage stores. We find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.},

  abstract = {Issues relating to agricultural tenancy have been viewed as important economic questions since the early writings of Smith and Mill. At the close of the twentieth century, interest in these issues remains strong. In developing countries with agrarian economies, this interest is stim-ulated by the perceived irnportance of land lease arrangements in either fostering or impeding economic developrnent. In the United States, where the proportion of farmland operated under lease arrangements has increased from 35{\%} in 1950 to 43{\%} in 1992 (USDA 1992), concem focuses on efficiency of resource use and issues such as effects of absentee landownership and tenant farming on the adoption of soii-conserving producfion practices. B eginning with Smith, agricultural land lease arrangements have been analyzed in the framework of several altemative paradigms. Each of these paradigms embodies assumpfions about characteristics and objectives of contracting parties and the insfitufional setting. In this article, we survey the literature through which most of these altemative paradigrns have evolved. We begin with classical models, which examine alternative land lease arrangements under assumptions of output certainty and symmetric informafion between landlords and tenants. These models focus on input use efficiency under altemative lease arrangements. Their general implication is that share contracts are inefficient compared with rent and wage contracts because a share tenant, who receives only a portion of output, will apply less-than-efficient input quantities in equating his share of the value of the marginal product with the marginal factor cost. We then discuss crificisms of this model and refinements, which lead to efficient resource use under share arrangements.},
