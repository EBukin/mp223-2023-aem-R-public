# Regression Discontinuity (Design)

-   Exploit **natural experiments** that constrain the role of chance in human affairs by arbitrary decision-making in policy that divide groups.

-   Rigid rules that aim to eliminate randomness create a natural experiment with the random components.

-   There area: **Sharp and Fuzzy** RDD

## Example 1. Birthdays and funerals [@Angrist2014]

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](img/w11/f4.1.PNG)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
-   After the 21st birthday, the number of death spikes in the USA.

-   Why?

-   In the number of death over age, there is some kind of **discontinuity**.
:::
:::

## Theoretical basis

-   Yong people are more likely to die from external causes such as car accidents or suicides.

-   Older people are more likely to die from internal causes (cancer).

. . .

Discontinuity in the death rate over age must be caused by some external factors.

-   Policy.

. . .

Regression Discontinuity (Design) **RDD** is called like that because it **uses regression to determine the discontinuity**.

## RDD: basics

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   $a$ age of the cohort of people;
-   $\bar M_a$ as the monthly average death rate for the cohort;
-   $D_a$ dummy variable that indicates if the cohort $a$ has right to drink alcohol.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: fragment
$$
D_{a}=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if}\ a \ge 21 \\
0, & \text{if}\ a < 21.
\end{cases}
$$
:::
:::

. . .

Treatment status $D_a$ is **discontinuous of the running variable** $a$ at the cut-off threshold $21$.

. . .

Using regression we can estimate the effect of the discontinuity $\rho$:

. . .

$$
\bar M_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_a + \gamma a + e_a,
$$

where

-   $\rho$ captures the jump in death due to the policy change,

-   $\gamma$ reflects internals/external causes substitution.

## RDD: anatomy

$$
\bar M_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_a + \gamma a + e_a,
$$

-   This is a **short model**.

    -   Does it suffer from the OVB?

-   No, because:

    -   treatment $D_a$ depends only on $a$, and

    -   there is no difference between 20 and 21 yo

    -   there is no difference between 20 years and 11 m.o. and 21y. and 1 m.o.

    -   we have "insiders" information about the similarity of the observations on two sides of the treatment/threshold.

## Sharp vs Fuzzy RDD

. . .

Sharp: the threshold is sharp and changes status from one to another immediately.

-   $a$ is age and age limit is a threshold that

-   probability of treatment changes from 0 to 1 at the threshold.

. . .

Fuzzy RDD:

-   Probability of intensity of treatment usually persists all along the running variables,

-   but at the cut-off probability of treatment intensity jumps.

## RDD: visual transparency

## RDD: robustness

![](img/w11/f4.5a.PNG)

## RDD: limitations

-   External validity:

-   Non-linear relationship between running variable and discontinuity:

-   Discontinuity must be sharp but it may not be observed in the data.

## RDD: bandwidth

Window around the threshold that we use to estimate the effect of the cut-off.

-   bandwidth is the trade-off between Bias and Variance.

-   Selecting bandwidth

    -   bandwidth should vary as a function of the sample size: more information, narrower the bandwidth.

    -   Point of the judgment call, but results should be robust given the bandwidth variation.

See @Imbens2011

## Non linearity and discontinuity (3)

## Non linearity solutions {.smaller}

1.  Polynomial:

-   $\bar M_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_a + \gamma_1 a + \gamma_2 a^2 + e_a$
-   could be too good and confirm prejudices;
-   we need to make a judgment call in a publication and check alternatives with robustness checks.

2.  Centering the running variable at the cut-off $a_0$ and adding the interaction term with $D_a$.

-   $\bar M_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_a + \gamma (a - a_0) + \delta [(a-a_0)D_a] + e_a$
-   When centered, $\rho$ is the the jump parameter.
-   change in the slope of $\rho$ before and after the threshold with: $\rho + \delta (a - a_0)$.

3.  Non linearity and the cut-off slope change could be combined:

-   $\bar M_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_a + \gamma_1 (a - a_0) + \gamma_2 (a - a_0) ^ 2 + \delta_1 [(a-a_0)D_a] + \delta_2 [(a-a_0) ^ 2 D_a] + e_a$

## Complexity vs simplicity

-   No general rule on choosing one or another model (simple vs complex);

-   Better to have robust not-sensitive results.

-   Visual inspection is a key.

-   Checks and balances are important. Check for the composites of the death for example.

-   There are also non-parametric approaches.

## Difference of the RD from the regression

-   In the regression we **control** for other factors

    -   hoping that this will **match counterfactual** for our factual and ensure the ceteris paribus.

-   In the RDD **running variable** $a$ is the one that ensures that:

    -   once we can observe the treatment we cannot observe the counterfactual.

-   It works at least for the **observations that are neighboring on the running variable**.

# RDD in agricultural and environmental economics

See: [@Wuepper2022]

## Specific considerations:

1.  Ag economics may rely on remote sensing and GIS data more.

2.  Distances from physical borders or longitude and latitude coordinates are the running variables
